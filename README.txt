# AEI Downscaling Python Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a **pixel-level downscaling routine for Irrigated Area (AEI)** based on the original C++ code developed by **Stefan Siebert**. The method allocates irrigated area across agricultural pixels using stepwise logic and multiple constraints (GMIA, cropland, pasture, and land availability), now rewritten in **Python** for reproducibility and extensibility.

This Python implementation was developed by:

## Original Author

The original algorithm and stepwise downscaling logic were created by **Prof. Stefan Siebert** and implemented in C++ as part of global agricultural water use research. This Python version retains the pixel-by-pixel logic and structure of the original method.

## Features

- **Supports multiple scenarios** (`base`, `low`, `upper`, `hyde_base`, `hyde_low`, `hyde_upper`)
- Step-by-step irrigation allocation (Steps 1â€“10) with:
  - GMIA-based constraints (Steps 1â€“7 run only if GMIA > 0)
  - Cropland/pasture fallback logic (Steps 8â€“10 run if GMIA == 0)
  - Hybrid allocation using **relative and absolute scaling**
- Per-step allocation tracking (`debug CSV` for each unit)
- Maximum allocation capped by **land availability**
- Compatible with **HYDE cropland/pasture maps**

## Input Data Requirements

- `GMIA` rasters for 2005, 2010, 2015
- `Cropland` and `Pasture` rasters from HYDE (5 arc-min)
- `Land availability` raster
- `Shapefiles` for subnational units (with `unit_code`)
- AEI statistics as `.xlsx` with matching `unit_code`

---

## Output

- **GeoTIFF** files for each scenario and year showing downscaled AEI (irrigated area)
- **Debug CSVs** with per-unit allocation summary:
  - Target vs allocated AEI
  - Step-by-step allocation values

## Usage

Set up the `base_dir` in the script to point to your data directory.
